# Web-scraping-excercise
An attempt at scraping the financial data from a website


IMPORTANT NOTE: the code was created for excercise purposes only and is not used to to scrape data from www.bankier.pl without permission (if necessary). I am not liable for any inproper use of the code presented in this repository.

If you need to scrape data from bankier website, make sure to check their robots.txt and if the admin of the website does not wish you to use web scraping on particular subsite, you should ask for their explicit permission before you send any requests.

Some of the code in this repository is not the fastest, however speed was not the most important factor in this case. I wanted to create a solid, working framework for obtaining data from a "slightly more difficult" website such as bankier.pl. By difficulties I mean various pop ups and extensive use of JS that requires more than just 'requests' library to access the data.
